## Custom blocks
The project uses a modular development system where possible.
All website pages should be divided into *"user sreens"* (sections). For this purpose, we use Gutenberg custom blocks functionality, with limited user input.

Blocks are registered and managed by the genesis-custom-blocks WordPress plugin. A user guide and documentation about the plugin can be found [here](https://developer.wpengine.com/genesis-custom-blocks/)

Gutenberg block editor [handbook](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/).

**Block categories** available from Edit Page (or Edit Post) screen:
- *Invest* - general theme blocks, that may be used again later
- *Invest Banners* - reusable banners, usually configured from theme admin panel options page
- *Invest Widgets* - reusable widgets, usually configured from theme admin panel options page
- *Invest-Blank* - template loaders, used for creating pages.

**All blocks should be added to their respectful category!*

---
### Block naming
For *non-blank* blocks, please try to keep `${what}-${where}-${name}` naming structure.<br>
Example: `widget-homepage-market-overview`

For blocks in *Invest-blank* category, the naming is pretty much self-explanatory. <br>
`${type}--&{inpit-fields-avaliable}`<br>
Examples:

```
blank-row--title-subtitle
blank-row--title-subtitle-text-btn
blank-col--image-title
blank-col--image-title-text-btn
```
**blank-row** - parent blocks that have "inner blocks" field available, where another Guttenberg blocks can be placed (images, embed video, text editor, other custom blocks, etc). They should be wrapped with `<section></section>` tags.

**blank-col** - child blocks that can be put inside blank-row--* blocks.

---
### Block structure

**A few common rules:**
- please, follow the [naming](#block-naming)
- all blocks should be added to their respectful category
- block .css and .js files should be located in the same folder as the block.php
- all bock *scripts should be [registered](#registering-javascript-files)!* 
- all user defined fields (content) should be located in *Editor fields*, while all developers fields (ID's, classes, etc) in *inspector fields*
- use human-readable slugs for fields
- dont forget to add logical search keywords
- each block should have a preview
- for [block styling](#block-styling) BEM is requiered

---
### Block template files
For a faster and more smooth workflow we use predefiend *blank blocks* as a template loaders with some user input fields. Input data is passed to templates using `get_template_part($template_path, $template_name , $input_data);` wordpress function. [Refference](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/get_template_part/).

All blank blocks are accessible from *Invest Blank* category and contain available user input fields in their [naming](#block-naming). 

---

**Core features**
- Each blank block has a *template* input field. It is located in the inspector's field  section on the Edit Page screen (the right pannel).*[screenshot](url)*
- To connect a template, please enter your template path in the following format: `block-templates/folder/template` (without .php extension) into the *template* input field. 
- Each blank block folder has a premade `template.php` file in it. It can be copy/pasted to the desired location for a more comfortable development process. [Example](blocks/blank-row--title-subtitle/template.php).
- All blank blocks follow the same naming logic for field *slugs*. 
---
**General rules**
- Block template files should be located in [block-templates/](block-templates/) folder.
- All template related files (.php, .css, .js, .scss) should have the same name *template.** and placed at the same folder
- If there is a `template.css` file in the folder, it will be enqueued automatically.
- All template ***scripts should be [registered](#registering-javascript-files)!***
- Each template should have a wrapper with unique class-name
- For [block styling](#block-styling) BEM is requiered
---
**Usefull tips**
- By default, you can access input values inside template by using `echo $args['field_slug']`. If you copy/pasted template from a block folder, you can also use variables. Example: `echo $title`.
- If your block or templates need some additional styles or scripts to work, please add them using `wp_enqueue_script(script-id)` and `wp_enqueue_style('style-id')` functions.
- Template path can be can be copy/pasted to *template* input fieild. It has some str_replace() functionality to make windows paths work as well. For VS Code, for example, right click -> Copy Relative Path (or `ctr + shift + C`) should work.


## Theme Javascript
The theme uses [jQuery-3.5.1](https://releases.jquery.com/jquery/) and [Bootstrap-4.6.0](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/getting-started/introduction/).
